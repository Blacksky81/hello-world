My first Repository

Hi to all the Terrans,

This is Blacksky81, casue I like the possibilities of 9*9.
And I love the sky of the night with Moon and stars.

I like to make hand-drip coffee and to read Vom Kriege.
I am studying cognitive psychology to create the Most Human-Brain-Like assistant AI system in the future.
Also, I study UX Design. My plan is to create pleasurable user experience in Augmented Reality with 4D interface.


Si vis pacem, para bellum.
